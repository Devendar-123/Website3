        <h2>Admissions are made easy by Galaxy</h2>
        <span>
          Galaxy specializes in personal careers guidance for university
          students and graduates as well as those already embarked on a career,
          or looking for a change in career. Sometimes students feel that they
          have no clear plans and are looking for a more individual, more
          imaginative approach than they have been able to find elsewhere. We
          look at academic achievements, aims, interests, skills and aptitudes
          and consider how these might be used in a variety of different career
          areas
